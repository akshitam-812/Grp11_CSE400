Prepare a formal structured lecture scribe using nothing but the documents to study writing examination. Re-render the sequence of the lecture, composing all the definitions, assumptions, notations, derivations, proofs, and examples in the same form that they occur in the source. Be scholarly and make sure that logic and reasoning is made based on the text only and should not be accompanied with extra explanations, summaries, and external comment. Sub-divide the content into distinct parts and bullet points to indicate logical relationships and give step-by-step mathematical derivations as a given in the slides. The last piece of work is the final draft, which must be a formal, self-reliant record of the lecture material.
