produce an organized study guide on exams, with specific reference to the information presented at the lectures, which is presented strictly and exclusively, in logical order, and without any external impressions, additional examples, or backdoor. Record all definitions, assumptions, proofs, derivations, and examples solutions verbatim as given and with a high level of academic language and step by step detail, so that one can be sure that they are followed to the letter during the revision. You should have clear headings and bold terminology to group the contents so that no information is contained outside the source text and that all the technical derivations remain as they are.
