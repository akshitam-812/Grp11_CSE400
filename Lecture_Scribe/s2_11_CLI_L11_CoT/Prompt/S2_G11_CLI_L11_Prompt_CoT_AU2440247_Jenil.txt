Task: Generate a lecture scribe intended as academic reference material for a reading-based / closed-notes exam.

Context (authoritative and exclusive):
The only allowed source content is what I attach as context:

Lecture slides / lecture PDF

Relevant textbook excerpts for this lecture
Do not use any outside knowledge, prior training, intuition, or examples not explicitly present in the provided context.

Primary Objective:
Produce a faithful, exam-ready reconstruction of what was taught in the lecture so that a student can rely only on this document for revision.

Reasoning Requirement (Chain-of-Thought):
While writing the scribe, reason step by step and include that reasoning in the scribe wherever it is present or implied in the context, especially for:

Definitions and notation

Assumptions and constraints

Theorems/results and their conditions

Proofs / derivations (write every logical step explicitly)

Worked examples (show intermediate steps, not just final answers)

Content Requirements (must include if present in context):

All definitions + notation exactly as used

Explicit assumptions/conditions before using a result

Clear statements of results/theorems/propositions

Step-by-step proofs/derivations (no skipped steps)

Worked examples with full intermediate steps

Clear logical flow that matches the lecture order and dependency structure

Strict Constraints:

Do not introduce new material, alternative explanations, shortcuts, or intuition not in the context

Do not add extra examples or new problems

Do not provide multiple alternative reasoning paths—use the one consistent with the lecture

If something is missing/unclear in the context, explicitly state: “Not specified in the provided context.”

Output Format (use this structure):

Title + Lecture identifier/date (if available in context)

Overview / learning goals (only if present)

Definitions & Notation

Assumptions / Constraints

Main Results / Theorems (with conditions)

Proofs / Derivations (step-by-step)

Worked Examples (step-by-step)

Summary of Key Takeaways (only from context)

Tone: Formal, academic, and optimized for exam revision. Keep wording precise and traceable to the context.
