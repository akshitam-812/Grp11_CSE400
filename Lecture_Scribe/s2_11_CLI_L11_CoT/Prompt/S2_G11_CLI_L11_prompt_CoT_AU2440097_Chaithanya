You are an advanced computational mathematician and master scholar 3. All that is required of you is to produce a rigorous and self-sufficient lecture scribe of the lecture, in this case, in the form of Lecture 11: Transformation of Random Variables using only the content of the given PDF document. This scribe should serve a conclusive reference document, one that will be adequate enough to enable one to study the content to pass an exam by closed-book without using any other book. Strict Observation of Standards of Source Material: You will have to use the given PDF. Do not propose any external concepts, interpretations, other notations, examples, proofs, derivation, or explanations that are not explicitly present in the PDF. In case a derivation step, a definition, a sample is not present in the PDF, you must not create one. But you need to build up and demonstrate the reasoning of each of the steps which exist in it, so that the logic is defined by the material provided only. Right and Obligatory Strengths and Contents: Comprehensive Reconstruction: Record all defs, all assumptions, notations, all theorems, all lemmas, all derivations, all proofs and all solved examples and all questions as they are written in the PDF, in the order they appear. Clear Step-by-step Rationalization: Derivations (e.g. calculating the PDF of Y = g(X)) In each derivation, you should write out and clearly indicate every logical and mathematical step. This involves but is not restricted to: Specifying the original PDF(s) and the function of transformation (s). Identification of the monotonicity of transformation, and the implication. Formulating and explaining explicitly the occurrence of the absolute value of the derivative, either (dx/dy)/(dx/dy), or (dy/dx)/(dy/dx). - Representing all the substitutions, line-by-line algebraic manipulation and substitutions of variables. - Explaining the use of Jacobian of a transformation of two random variables stating and meaning it as it is presented. - Logical Dependency and Flow: Organize the scribe by making it clear who logical dependencies among ideas exist and whether they follow the flow in the PDF through the lecture. The justification behind every new idea should be well-following material that has been established in the PDF. The Derivations to be Reconstructed Particularly with Line-by-Line Explicit Logic: 1. Transformation of a single random variable: In the general result Y = g(X) write out the derivation of the PDF of Y, noting howered in this respect the dependence on the derivative and on the operation of absolute value, as inspired by the CDF approach to the PDF. 2. Definement: This is the logical procedure that one would take to determine the combined transformation of two random variables. Demonstrate the derivation of the PDF of Z step by step, with the logical derivation path of the joint PDF f X,Y (x,y) for the derivation of the resulting PDF f Z (z) being absolutely clear. This is required to encompass the auxiliary variable as well as the integration of the Jacobian as found in the PDF. 3. Illustrative Problem: Recreate the problem of the uniformly distributed random variable X ( -1 to 1) and its transformation Y = sin( X/2). In this example, one cannot answer line-by-line by reasoning through each mathematical substitution and transformation and providing a breakdown of how derived formula of the PDF of Y is used. Formatting and Tone: -Formal Academic Tone: Descriptions should be the use of accurate, formal and objective mathematical language. No imaginative writing, comment, or subjective comments. Hierarchical Structure: Layout the scribe with the precise headings in the lecture outline: 1. Change of Single random variable 2. Two-variable function Two random variables can be graphically represented as the functions of two variables. Examples A Sub-headings (e.g., 1.1, 1.2) may be added as needed to represent an internal structure of PDF. Clarity to Revision: Bullet points, use of indentation and apparent division of definitions, important steps in proving, and essential results. Marking label equations (e.g. (1), (2)) As in the PDF when labeled, or mark them to be clear in the derivation flow. Direct Start: You will be starting the response with the scribe material, and you will start with the title of the lecture 11: Transformation of Random Variables. No introduction, greetings, and no description of your process. Finally, submissions are required to be a whole, cohesive and rigorous document of final output, which a student could fully count on to study on prior to exam, provided the complete copy of the output is availed. It should be an ideal, non-interpretive re-creation of the given lecture slides, with all of the derivations and logical considerations being clear-cut and easily traceable.
