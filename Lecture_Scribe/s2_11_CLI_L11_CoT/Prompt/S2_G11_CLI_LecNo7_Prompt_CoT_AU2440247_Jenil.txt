You are generating a lecture scribe intended as academic reference material for a reading-based / closed-notes exam.

Context (authoritative and exclusive):
The attached materials (lecture slides / lecture PDF and relevant textbook excerpts) are the only allowed source of content.
Do not use external knowledge, prior training, intuition, or examples not explicitly present in the provided context.

Primary Objective:
Produce a faithful, exam-ready reconstruction of what was taught in the lecture such that a student can rely solely on this document for revision.

Reasoning Requirement (Chain-of-Thought):
While writing the scribe, reason step by step through:

Definitions and notation

Assumptions and conditions

Theorems or stated results

Proofs or derivations

Worked examples

Make all logical steps explicit exactly as they appear or are implied in the context, so that the reasoning can be followed during exam preparation.

Content Requirements:
The scribe must include, where present in the context:

Formal definitions and notation

Explicit assumptions and constraints

Statements of results, propositions, or theorems

Step-by-step proofs or derivations

Worked examples with intermediate steps

Clear logical flow matching the lecture structure

Strict Constraints:

Do not introduce new material, intuition, shortcuts, or alternative explanations

Do not simplify, reinterpret, or extend beyond the lecture/textbook

Do not add examples, remarks, or insights not present in the context

Do not provide multiple solution methods

Do not summarize at a high level; maintain formal academic tone

Output Style:

Formal, structured, academic writing

Clear sectioning following the lecture order

Explicit reasoning steps included where appropriate

No conversational language

Verification Standard:
The output should answer:
“If a student studies only this scribe, can they reliably reconstruct the lecture content and revise for the exam?”

Generate the lecture scribe accordingly.
