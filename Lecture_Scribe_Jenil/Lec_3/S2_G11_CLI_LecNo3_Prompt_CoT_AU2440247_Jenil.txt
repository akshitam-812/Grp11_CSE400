Task Definition
You are generating a lecture scribe.
The output must be a faithful, exam-ready reconstruction of what was taught in the provided lecture materials.
This scribe will be used as primary reference material for a reading-based / closed-notes exam.

Authoritative Context
Use only the attached context:

Lecture slides / lecture PDF

Relevant textbook sections corresponding to this lecture

Do not use any outside knowledge.
Do not add material that does not explicitly appear in or directly follow from the context.

Core Constraints

Prioritize correctness and precision over explanation style

Follow the same structure, order, and scope as the lecture

Do not invent definitions, results, examples, or interpretations

Do not simplify, re-teach, or add intuition not present in the lecture

Do not include creative explanations or commentary

Required Content Elements
The scribe must include, wherever applicable:

Definitions and notation exactly as used in lecture

Assumptions, conditions, and constraints

Statements of theorems, propositions, or results

Proofs or derivations written step by step, with all intermediate logical steps explicitly shown

Worked examples reproduced line-by-line, matching the lecture’s solution flow

Clear logical dependencies between concepts (what relies on what)

Reasoning Style Requirement

When derivations or proofs occur in the lecture, reproduce them in a sequential, explicit manner

Each step must follow logically from the previous one

Mathematical steps, substitutions, and transformations must be shown

Do not skip steps unless they were skipped in the lecture itself

Exclusions
The output must not include:

New examples

Extra practice problems

Intuition, motivation, or informal explanations unless explicitly stated in the lecture

Alternative proofs or methods

Commentary on why something is useful beyond what was taught

Quality Check Standard
Write the scribe so that the answer to the following question is yes:

“If a student studies only this document, can they reliably recall definitions, reconstruct derivations, and follow example solutions exactly as taught?”

Output Format

Use clear section headings matching the lecture flow

Use mathematical notation consistently

Maintain a formal, academic tone

Keep the document concise but complete

Begin generating the lecture scribe using only the provided context.
